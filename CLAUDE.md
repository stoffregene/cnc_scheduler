# CNC Manufacturing Scheduler Development Progress

## Project Overview
A comprehensive React/Node.js/PostgreSQL application for CNC manufacturing job scheduling with drag-and-drop functionality, intelligent employee assignment, and automated conflict resolution.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI, @dnd-kit (drag-and-drop), date-fns
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with complex relational schema
- **Key Libraries**: react-hot-toast, axios, multer, csv-parser

## Phase 1: Core Scheduling Engine âœ… COMPLETED
### Features Implemented:
- [x] PostgreSQL database schema with proper relationships
- [x] Job management (CRUD operations, CSV import)
- [x] Machine and employee management 
- [x] Automated backward scheduling algorithm
- [x] Employee shift pattern integration
- [x] REST API endpoints for all core functionality
- [x] Basic React frontend with routing

### Key Files:
- `server/services/schedulingService.js` - Core scheduling logic
- `server/routes/*.js` - API endpoints
- `database/migrations/*.sql` - Database schema

## Phase 2: Visual Scheduling System âœ… COMPLETED
### Features Implemented:
- [x] Calendar/Gantt view with week/day/month modes
- [x] Drag-and-drop manual override functionality
- [x] Machine queue boards (Kanban-style)
- [x] Employee assignment preservation during moves
- [x] Automatic operator assignment for cross-machine moves
- [x] Operation-machine compatibility validation
- [x] Unschedule/reschedule job functionality
- [x] **Operation sequence validation (prevent out-of-order dragging)** âœ… NEW

### Intelligent Validation Features:
1. **Machine Compatibility**: Prevents moving production operations to INSPECT machines and vice versa
2. **Employee Assignment**: Automatically finds qualified operators when moving between machines
3. **Sequence Validation**: Prevents dragging operations out of their proper sequence order
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Offers automatic job rescheduling for invalid moves

### Key Files:
- `client/src/pages/ScheduleView.js` - Main drag-and-drop scheduling interface
- `server/routes/scheduling.js` - Scheduling API endpoints including reschedule/unschedule
- `server/routes/jobs.js` - Added `/api/jobs/:id/routings` endpoint for sequence validation
- `server/routes/machines.js` - Machine operators endpoint

### Validation Logic:
```javascript
// Machine compatibility check
const isIncompatibleMove = 
  (!isInspectOperation && isTargetInspectMachine) || 
  (isInspectOperation && !isTargetInspectMachine);

// Sequence validation 
const validateOperationSequence = async (draggedSlot, targetDay) => {
  // Prevents scheduling operations before prerequisites
  // Prevents scheduling operations after subsequent operations
}
```

## Phase 3: Advanced Features ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
### Current Status:
- [x] ~~Build collision detection and automatic rescheduling on conflicts~~
- [ ] Add employee workload visualization 
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution interface
- [ ] Build job displacement analysis - "what if" rescheduling impact visualization

### Next Priority Tasks:
1. **Collision Detection** - Detect overlapping schedules and auto-resolve
2. **Employee Workload Visualization** - Show employee capacity and utilization
3. **Conflict Resolution Interface** - UI for managing scheduling conflicts
4. **Impact Analysis** - Show downstream effects of schedule changes

## API Endpoints

### Jobs
- `GET /api/jobs` - List all jobs with routings
- `GET /api/jobs/:id` - Get specific job details
- `GET /api/jobs/:id/routings` - Get job routing sequence for validation
- `POST /api/jobs` - Create new job
- `PUT /api/jobs/:id` - Update job
- `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` - Delete job

### Scheduling  
- `GET /api/scheduling/slots` - Get scheduled slots (supports job_id, machine_id, employee_id filters)
- `PUT /api/scheduling/slots/:id` - Update schedule slot (drag-and-drop)
- `POST /api/scheduling/schedule-job/:id` - Auto-schedule specific job
- `POST /api/scheduling/reschedule-job/:id` - Unschedule and reschedule job
- `DELETE /api/scheduling/unschedule-job/:id` - Clear job schedule
- `GET /api/scheduling/available-slots` - Find optimal time slots for operations

### Machines
- `GET /api/machines` - List all machines
- `GET /api/machines/:id/operators` - Get qualified operators for machine

## Database Schema Notes

### Key Tables:
- `jobs` - Job master data
- `job_routings` - Operations with sequence_order for validation
- `schedule_slots` - Scheduled time slots
- `machines` - CNC machines
- `employees` - Workers (contains fallback schedule data)
- `employee_work_schedules` - **PRIMARY** source for operator work hours 
- `employee_shift_schedule` - Alternative schedule configuration
- `operator_machine_assignments` - Employee qualifications

### Employee Schedule Architecture:
**Data Sources (in priority order):**
1. **`employee_work_schedules`** - Actual operator schedules used by frontend (/operator-schedule)
2. **`employee_shift_schedule`** - Alternative schedule configuration
3. **`employees`** table - Fallback with custom_start_hour, custom_end_hour fields

**Database Function**: `get_employee_working_hours(employee_id, date)` 
- Used by scheduling service to determine operator availability
- Recently fixed to prioritize `employee_work_schedules` table
- Returns: start_hour, end_hour, duration_hours, is_overnight, is_working_day

### Sequence Validation:
Operations use `sequence_order` field in `job_routings` table:
- SAW operations: sequence_order = 1
- HMC operations: sequence_order = 2  
- INSPECT operations: sequence_order = 3

## Recent Fixes & Improvements

### Manual Rescheduling System âœ… COMPLETED:
1. **Drag-and-Drop Removed**: Eliminated complex drag-and-drop interface per user feedback that it was "almost useless"
2. **Enhanced Manual Rescheduling**: Added comprehensive date picker with machine selection capabilities
3. **Smart Machine Filtering**: INSPECT operations only show INSPECT machines, production operations exclude INSPECT machines
4. **Machine Swapping**: Full capability to change operation machines with automatic operator reassignment
5. **Trickle-Down Scheduling**: Automatically reschedules all subsequent operations when moving any operation
6. **Visual Summary Modal**: Shows detailed summary of what operations were moved and where

### Critical Schedule Fixes âœ… RESOLVED:

**1. Employee Work Hours Fix**:
- **Issue**: Scheduler using default 8 AM - 5 PM instead of actual schedules
- **Solution**: Fixed database function to prioritize `employee_work_schedules` table
- **Result**: Now uses accurate hours (e.g., Drew: 4:30 AM - 3 PM, Kyle: 6 AM - 4:30 PM)

**2. SAW/Waterjet 24-Hour Lag Time Fix**:
- **Issue**: HMC operations couldn't be scheduled after SAW due to validation conflicts
- **Solution**: Fixed slot generation to respect minimum start time within shifts
- **Technical Fix**: Changed from `$3::date + interval` to `$3::timestamp + interval` in query
- **Result**: Properly enforces 24-hour minimum lag while allowing flexible scheduling

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed `daysInView` variable scope issues in drag handlers
- Resolved employee assignment preservation during manual moves  
- Corrected database inconsistencies with utility scripts
- Added proper error handling for missing employee assignments
- **Fixed scheduling service to use correct employee work hours from `employee_work_schedules` table**

## Development Notes

### Testing Commands:
- `npm run dev` - Start development servers (client + server)
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality  
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript validation

### Environment Setup:
- Database: PostgreSQL with `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Ports: Client (3000), Server (5000)
- Upload directory: `server/uploads/` for CSV imports

## Architecture Patterns

### Frontend:
- Component-based React architecture
- Material-UI for consistent styling
- Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Manual rescheduling system with date picker and machine selection

### Backend:
- RESTful API design
- Service layer pattern for business logic
- Transaction-based database operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Data Flow:
1. User interacts with manual rescheduling controls in modal interface
2. Frontend validates date and machine selection
3. Backend performs business logic validation and machine swapping
4. Database updates with proper transaction handling
5. Frontend refreshes data and shows summary modal

## Security Considerations
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries  
- File upload restrictions for CSV imports
- Environment variable protection for database credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Schedule Timing Issues
**Problem**: Jobs scheduled at wrong times or outside operator availability
**Check**: 
1. Verify `/operator-schedule` page shows correct employee hours
2. Test database function: `SELECT * FROM get_employee_working_hours(employee_id, CURRENT_DATE)`
3. Compare with API: `GET /api/employees/:id/work-schedules`
4. **Root Cause**: Usually function not using `employee_work_schedules` table

**Fix Commands**:
```sql
-- Check if function uses correct table
SELECT * FROM get_employee_working_hours(9, CURRENT_DATE); -- Test with Drew

-- If incorrect, run fix script:
node server/fix-working-hours-function.js
```

### Database Inconsistencies
**Utility Scripts Available**:
- `check-all-schedules.js` - Audit all employee schedule data
- `check-drew-details.js` - Specific employee schedule debugging  
- `fix-working-hours-function.js` - Repair schedule function
- `check-sequence-schema.js` - Validate operation sequence data

## Current Todo List Status âœ… ALL COMPLETED

### Recently Completed Tasks:
1. âœ… **Manual Rescheduling Date Picker** - Added comprehensive date picker to job detail modal
2. âœ… **Trickle-Down Rescheduling** - Implemented automatic rescheduling of subsequent operations
3. âœ… **Employee Schedule Validation** - Fixed and validated operator working hours integration
4. âœ… **Chunk Handling** - Fixed manual rescheduling to move ALL chunks of multi-day operations
5. âœ… **Dependent Operations** - Ensured INSPECT and subsequent operations get rescheduled properly
6. âœ… **Date Validation** - Fixed timezone issues and employee work day validation
7. âœ… **Visual Summary** - Added summary modal showing what operations were moved where
8. âœ… **Forward vs Backward Scheduling** - Implemented smart scheduling direction based on operation sequence
9. âœ… **Partial vs Full Reschedule** - Smart logic to only reschedule current + subsequent operations
10. âœ… **Drag-and-Drop Removal** - Completely removed drag-and-drop functionality per user feedback
11. âœ… **Machine Selection Enhancement** - Added machine/machine group selection to manual rescheduling
12. âœ… **Machine Swapping Capability** - Full support for changing operation machines with operator reassignment

### Outstanding Issues to Fix:
- **Partial Reschedule Bug**: When rescheduling later operations (HMC, INSPECT), the system says "Job already scheduled" because SAW operation still exists. Need to improve the scheduling service to handle partial reschedules properly.
